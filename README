This is a old project I made, and recently found and improved opon.
It's a 2x2x2 Rubiks cube to play around with.
It can optimaly sove itself from any postion,.
It will calculate a solution map in ram memmory in no time.

This branch is a version where only double moves are possible.
Could be interesting.

And lastly, this is mostly a project for me to learn git and GitHub for now.
