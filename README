This is a little project I found.
A 2x2x2 version of Rubiks famous cube.
It can self solve, with optimal solutions.
You will have to generate a "map" file.

Wish is don in 1 - 2 minutes.

The "map" file is to big for GitHubs rules.

And lastly, this is mostly a project for me to learn git and GitHub for now.
