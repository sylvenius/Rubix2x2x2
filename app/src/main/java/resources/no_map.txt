I couldn't find the file "HashCube.txt"
in this folder wher I am.

Please press Calc to generate one.
Takes ruffly 1 min, depending on your computor.

After that close this dialouge and the Cube should work.

It's a text file, you could edit if that your thing, but it will moste likely
not work after that, throw it away ang generate a new oneaka restart the program.
